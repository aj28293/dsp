[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

Using the variable totalwgt_lb, investigate whether first babies are lighter or heavier than others.   
Compute Cohenâ€™s effect size to quantify the difference between the groups. How does it compare to the difference in pregnancy length?   

firsts.totalwgt_lb.mean(), others.totalwgt_lb.mean()    
'''First borns appear to be slightly lighter on average than other babies'''   

CohenEffectSize(firsts.totalwgt_lb, others.totalwgt_lb)    
-0.088672927072602006    

'''prglngth = 0.028879044654449883      
totalwgt_lb = -0.088672927072602006    
In both cases the difference in means are both small with 0.029 and -0.89 std deviations respectively,    
depending on the situation may be considered insignificant differences.'''
