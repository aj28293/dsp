[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

The numbers generated by random.random are supposed to be    
uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the    
same probability.    
Generate 1000 numbers from random.random and plot their PMF and CDF.    
Is the distribution uniform?    

rn = np.random.random(1000)   

cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(rn, label='random')    
thinkplot.Cdf(cdf)    

pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(rn, label='random')    

thinkplot.Pmf(pmf, linewidth = 0.05)    
thinkplot.Config(xlabel='Random', ylabel='PMF')     

Based on the CDF and PMF plots, the random numbers seem to be uniformly distributed.
